As a child, Ronaldo played for Andorinha from 1992 to 1995,[21]where his father was the kit man,[12]and later spent two years withNacional. In 1997, aged 12, he went on a three-day trial withSporting CP, who signed him for a fee of £1,500.[22]He subsequently moved from Madeira toLisbonto joinSporting CP's youth system.[22]By age 14, while struggling with his school duties and responsibilities in Escola EB2 de Telheiras, his school in theTelheirasarea of Lisbon, Ronaldo believed he had the ability to play semi-professionally and agreed with his mother and histutorat Sporting CP,Leonel Pontes,[23]to cease his education to focus entirely on football.[24][25]With a troubled life as a student,[26]and although living in Lisbon area away from his Madeiran family,[27][28]he did not complete schooling beyond the 6th grade.[29][30]While popular with other students at school, he had been expelled after throwing a chair at his teacher, who he said had "disrespected" him.[24]One year later, he was diagnosed withtachycardia, a condition that could have forced him to give up playing football.[31]Ronaldo underwent heart surgery where a laser was used tocauterisemultiplecardiac pathwaysinto one, altering his restingheart rate.[32]He was discharged from the hospital hours after the procedure and resumed training a few days later.[33]In 2021, Cristiano Ronaldo's mother, Dolores Aveiro, stated in an interview for Sporting CP's official television channel (Sporting TV) that her son would be abricklayerif he had not become a professional football player.[34]

Growing up, Ronaldo idolised the Brazilian footballersRonaldinhoandRonaldo Nazário, and has described them as leaving "a beautiful history in football".[35]

After impressing in Sporting'syouth teams, he was promoted to themain teamby first-team managerLászló Bölöni. At age 17, on 14 August 2002, he played his first official match for the first team, in aUEFA Champions League qualifying roundatJosé Alvalade StadiumagainstInter Milan,[36]and hisPrimeira Ligadebut, took place a month later againstBraga, and on 7 October, he scored two goals againstMoreirensein their 3–0 win.[37]Over the course of the2002–03 season, his representatives suggested the player toLiverpoolmanagerGérard HoullierandBarcelonapresidentJoan Laporta.[38]ManagerArsène Wenger, who was interested in signing Ronaldo, met with him atArsenal's stadium in November to discuss a possible transfer.[39]

Manchester UnitedmanagerAlex Fergusonwas determined to acquire Ronaldo on a permanent move urgently, after Sporting defeated United 3–1 at the inauguration of theEstádio José Alvaladeon 6 August 2003. Initially, United had planned to sign Ronaldo and loan him back to Sporting for a year.[40]Having been impressed by him, the United players urged Ferguson to sign him. After the game, Ferguson said Ronaldo was "one of the most exciting young players" he had ever seen.[40][41]

"There have been a few players described as 'the new George Best' over the years, but this is the first time it's been a compliment to me."

On 12 August 2003, less than a week after the friendly that impressed Ferguson, Manchester United signed Ronaldo for £12 million,[43]an England record for a teenager.[44]This also made him the first Portuguese player to sign for the club.[45]

Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received thesquad number7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players asGeorge Best,Eric CantonaandDavid Beckham.[46]Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[47]A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."[48]

Ronaldo made his debut as a substitute in a 4–0 home win overBolton Wanderersin the Premier League on 16 August 2003.[49]His performance earned praise from Best, who hailed it as "undoubtedly the most exciting debut" he had ever seen.[42]Ronaldo scored his first goal for Manchester United with a free-kick in a 3–0 win overPortsmouthon 1 November.[50]On 15 May 2004, in a victory against Aston Villa, Ronaldo scored the opening goal and later received the firstred cardof his career.[51][52]Ronaldo ended his first season in English football with a trophy, scoring the opening goal in United's 3–0 win overMillwallin the2004 FA Cup Final.[53]BBC punditAlan Hansendescribed him as the star of the final.[54]The British press had been critical of Ronaldo during the season for his "elaborate" step-overs in trying to beat opponents,[55]but teammateGary Nevillesaid he was "not a show pony, but the real thing", and predicted he would become a world-class player.[56]

"He has got the tricks and party pieces, we know that, but they're not much good unless there is something at the end of it all. We still have to remember, of course, that the lad is only 19 years of age. Considering that, you have to say he has got massive talent. His feet are mesmerising at times, and if he can couple that with some consistently good crossing, the future looks frightening."

At the start of 2005, Ronaldo played two of his best matches of the2004–05 season, producing a goal and an assist against Aston Villa and scoring twice againstrivalsArsenal.[57][58]Ronaldo won his second trophy in English football, theFootball League Cup, after scoring the third goal in United's 4–0 final win overWigan Athletic.[59]

With his start in Portugal'sUEFA Euro 2024opener against theCzech Republic, Ronaldo became the first player to feature in six European Championships, having previously been the first player to appear in five.[243]Later that year, on 5 September, he scored his 900th career goal in a 2–1 victory overCroatiain theUEFA Nations League.[244]On 8 June 2025, Ronaldo won his second UEFA Nations League title, helping Portugal defeat Spain in the final, scoring 8 goals in 9 games in the tournament.[245]

A versatileattacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the pitch,[247]and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet.[248]Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester United, he was typically deployed as a traditionalwingeron the right side of midfield, where he regularly looked to delivercrossesinto the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo became noted for hisdribblingand flair, often displaying an array oftricksandfeints,[249][250]such as thestep oversand so-called 'chops' that became his trademark;[251]he has also been known to use theflip-flap.[252]

His strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy and height of1.87 m (6 ft1+1⁄2in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently, many of his goals have been headers.[253][254][255]Ronaldo holds the record for the highest recorded jump in football history, measuring 2.93 metres (9 ft 7 in), which he achieved during a match against Manchester United while playing for Real Madrid in the round of 16 of the UEFA Champions League in 2013.[256]Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played acreative rolefor his team, often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.[249][253]

In his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both as astrikerand as asupporting forward, or even as anattacking midfielderon occasion.[253]He developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability.[253]An accuratepenalty kicktaker,[257]he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful,bendingfree kicks.[258]When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using theknuckleballtechnique, which was developed byJuninho Pernambucano.[259]He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball, which involves him standing with his legs far apart.[260]Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking free kicks, former United assistant managerMike Phelancommented: "People used to put the ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world is watching him."[261]

At Real Madrid, Ronaldo continued to play a more offensive role, while his creative and defensive duties became more limited, although not entirely diminished.[264]Initially deployed as acentre forwardby managersManuel PellegriniandJosé Mourinho, he was later moved back onto the left wing, though in a free tactical role; this position allowed him to drift into the centre at will to get onto the end of crosses and score, or draw out defenders with his movement off the ball and leave space for teammates to exploit.[264][265][266]Madrid's counter-attacking style of play also allowed him to become a more efficient and consistent player, as evidenced by his record-breaking goalscoring feats. While he mainly drew praise in the media for his prolific goalscoring, Ronaldo also demonstrated his ability as an effective creator in this role.[267][268][269]This unique role has been described by pundits as that of a "false", "attacking", or "goalscoring winger", as Ronaldo effectively almost functioned as a striker at times with his central runs into the penalty area, despite actually playing on the left flank.[265][270]From 2013 onwards, under managerCarlo Ancelotti, he effectively adapted his style to the physical effects of ageing with increasingly reduced off-the-ball movement and general involvement, completing fewer dribbles and passes per game, and instead focusing on short-distance creating and goalscoring.[264][271][272]Since 2017, Ronaldo adapted his style of play yet again to become more of a free-roaming centre forward under managerZinedine Zidane, a role in which he continued to excel and maintain a prolific goalscoring record; in this position, he earned praise in the media for his intelligent movement both on and off the ball, positional sense, link-up play and finishing, as well as his ability to lose or anticipate his markers, find space in the box and score from few touches or opportunities.[273][274][275]

In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under managerMassimiliano Allegri, depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions withMario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses.[276][277]On occasion he also played in an attacking partnership alongside Mandžukić in a 4–3–1–2, 4–4–2, or 3–5–2 formation.[278][279][280]He continued to play a similar role in his second season with the club under managerMaurizio Sarri.[277]

Ronaldo is widely regarded as one of the two best players of his generation, alongside Argentina forwardLionel Messi.[281]Winning his firstBallon d'Orin2008by a record-high vote count at age 23, over the next decade Ronaldo has often featured in debates concerning who is the greatest player in history.[282]Acclaimed for his prolific and consistent goal-scoring,[283]he is considered a decisive player who is also a game changer,[284]especially in important and high-pressured situations.[285]In a 2018 article forBleacher Report, formerNBAstarSteve Nashcompared Ronaldo toMichael Jordan: "On the pitch, [Ronaldo's] learned how to make his play—less explosive in individual movements—more successful for the team, and in that, I see the greatness of Jordan." In the same article, Ronaldo was ranked first in the ranking of the 50 most influential people in sports culture for 2018.[286]

"In the six years we had him, you just saw his game grow all the time, and he was a fantastic player. Now you see the complete player. His decision-making, his maturity, his experience, plus all the great skills he has got, they all make him the complete player."

Ronaldo is noted for his work ethic, elite body conditioning and dedication to improvement on the training pitch, as well being regarded as a natural leader.[288][289]On his longevity and "extraordinary commitment to physical preparation", Adam Bate ofSky Sportssaid: "Dedication is a huge part of staying at the top and Ronaldo's focus is perhaps unparalleled within the game."[262]While stating they were stylistically different players who shared an equal desire to score goals, former Brazil internationalRonaldopraised Cristiano's approach to training, arguing that "there are so few players who take care of their body like he does. I trained because I had to, he does it because he loves it."[290]His drive and determination to succeed are fuelled by a desire to be talked about alongside other greats such asPeléandDiego Maradonaonce retiring.[291]He is credited, along with his compatriot, coachJosé Mourinho, with inspiring changing fortunes of Portuguese football in 2010s and 2020s.[292]At times, he has been criticised forsimulatingwhen tackled.[293]He was also occasionally criticised early in his career by manager Alex Ferguson, teammates and the media for being a selfish or overly flamboyant player.[294]Jonathan WilsonofThe Guardianopined that Ronaldo had made Juventus, who he joined aged 33 in 2018, weaker, due to "his relative immobility" in his mid-30s, even if his personal goal-scoring output remained high.[295]

During his career, Ronaldo has also been described as having an "arrogant image" on the pitch,[296]with Ronaldo stating that he had become a "victim" because of how he was portrayed in the media.[297]He is often seen moaning, gesticulating and scowling while trying to inspire his team to victory,[296]with Ronaldo insisting that his competitive nature should not be mistaken for arrogance.[297]His managers, teammates and various journalists have said that this reputation has caused an unfair image of him.[298][299][300]

Ronaldo has adopted severalgoal celebrationsthroughout his career, including one particular celebration which gained widespread coverage in the media, when he squatted and stared directly into a camera on the sidelines of the pitch with his hand on his chin.[301][302][303]After scoring a goal, he usually celebrates with a "storming jump" and "turn", before "landing in spread-eagled fashion"[302]into his "signature power stance",[303]while usually simultaneously exclaiming "Sí" (Spanish and Italian for "yes").[301][304]This trademark celebration has been dubbed the "Siu" orsiuuuin the media.[301][302][305]It has also been known as "suiii", "siiuuu", "siii" or "Right Here Right Now", formally theCristiano Ronaldo celebration. Since Ronaldo first performed the gesture in 2013,[306]it has been widely imitated by athletes and personalities both in and outside of football when celebrating scoring in respective sports or a significant achievement, and is widely regarded as the most iconic association footballcelebrationof all time.[307]

The gesture was first performed by Ronaldo on 7 August, during the2013 International Champions Cup Finalbetween Real Madrid andChelsea. Ronaldo gave Madrid a 2–1 lead with afree kickwhen he headed in a cross fromIsco, helping Madrid beat Chelsea 3–1 to claim theInternational Champions Cupand celebrating with his first "Siuuu". During an interview after the match against Chelsea when he first performed the gesture, Ronaldo explained he scored the goal and "it just felt natural" and "didn't know where it came from". He started doing it more often and when the supporters see it they are reminded of him.[308]

The phrase "siu" is derived from Portuguesesim, meaning "yes". This was confirmed by Ronaldo in an interview in 2023, almost a decade since he first performed it. Ronaldo explained that the phrase "Siuuu" simply means yes, but "meaning it very strongly".[309]

Both Ronaldo and Lionel Messi have scored in multipleUEFA Champions Leaguefinals, have regularly broken the 50-goal barrier in a single season, and are the twoleading goal scorers in history. Sports journalists and pundits regularly weigh the individual merits of both players in an attempt to argue who they believe is the best player in modern football or in the history of the game.[310]It has been compared to severalsports rivalries, among them theMuhammad Ali–Joe Frazierrivalry in boxing, theBorg–McEnroe rivalryin tennis and theSenna–Prost rivalryfromFormula Onemotor racing.[311][312]Some commentators choose to analyse the differing physiques and playing styles of the two.[313]Part of the debate revolves around the contrasting personalities of the two players, as Ronaldo is sometimes depicted as an arrogant and theatrical showoff, while Messi is portrayed as a shy, humble character.[314][315][316]

"It's part of my life now. People are bound to compare us. He tries to do his best for his club and for his national team, as I do, and there is a degree of rivalry with both of us trying to do the best for the teams we represent."

In a 2012 interview, Ronaldo commented on the rivalry, saying: "I think we push each other sometimes in the competition, this is why the competition is so high."[318]Alex Ferguson, Ronaldo's manager during his time at Manchester United, opined: "I don't think the rivalry against each other bothers them. I think they have their own personal pride in terms of wanting to be the best."[319]Messi himself denied any rivalry, saying that it was "only the media, the press, who wants us to be at loggerheads but I've never fought with Cristiano."[320]Responding to the claims that he and Messi do not get on well on a personal level, Ronaldo commented: "We don't have a relationship outside the world of football, just as we don't with a lot of other players." Ronaldo added that in years to come he hopes they can laugh about it together, stating: "We have to look on this rivalry with a positive spirit, because it's a good thing."[317]Representing archrivals Barcelona and Real Madrid, the two players faced each other at least twice every season in the world's biggest club game,El Clásico, which is among the world's most viewed annual sporting events.[321]

In a debate atOxford Unionin October 2013, when asked whether FIFA presidentSepp Blatterpreferred Messi or Ronaldo, Blatter paid tribute to the work ethic of the Argentine before taking a swipe at Ronaldo, claiming "one of them has more expenses for the hairdresser than the other." Real Madrid demanded and promptly received a full apology. In response to Blatter's "commander" on the pitch comment, Ronaldo issued his own riposte with a mock-salute celebration after scoring a penalty against Sevilla.[322]In August 2019, Ronaldo and Messi were interviewed while sat next to each other prior to the announcement of theUEFA Men's Player of the Year, with Ronaldo stating: "I pushed him and he pushed me as well. So it's good to be part of the history of football."[323]

In September 2023, Ronaldo declared that his rivalry with Messi was over and "gone", after 36 official fixtures and 15 years of "sharing the stage".[324]

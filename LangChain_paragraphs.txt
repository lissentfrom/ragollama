LangChainis asoftware frameworkthat helps facilitate the integration oflarge language models(LLMs) into applications. As a language model integration framework, LangChain's use-cases largely overlap with those of language models in general, including document analysis andsummarization,chatbots, andcode analysis.[2]

LangChain was launched in October 2022 as anopen sourceproject by Harrison Chase, while working at machine learning startup Robust Intelligence. The project quickly garnered popularity,[3]with improvements from hundreds of contributors onGitHub, trending discussions onTwitter, lively activity on the project'sDiscordserver, manyYouTubetutorials, and meetups in San Francisco and London. In April 2023, LangChain had incorporated and the new startup raised over $20 million in funding at a valuation of at least $200 million from venture firmSequoia Capital, a week after announcing a $10 million seed investment fromBenchmark.[4][5]

In the third quarter of 2023, the LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) was introduced, which provides adeclarativeway to define chains of actions.[6][7]

In October 2023 LangChain introduced LangServe, a deployment tool to host LCEL code as a production-readyAPI.[8]

LangChain's developers highlight the framework's applicability to use-cases includingchatbots,[9]retrieval-augmented generation,[10]documentsummarization,[11]and synthetic data generation.[12]

As of March 2023, LangChain included integrations with systems including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft Azurecloud storage;[13]API wrappers for news, movie information, and weather;Bashfor summarization, syntax and semantics checking, and execution ofshell scripts; multipleweb scrapingsubsystems and templates;few-shot learningprompt generation support; finding and summarizing "todo" tasks in code;Google Drivedocuments, spreadsheets, and presentations summarization, extraction, and creation;Google SearchandMicrosoft Bingweb search;[14]OpenAI, Anthropic, and Hugging Face language models;iFixitrepair guides and wikis search and summarization;MapReducefor question answering, combining documents, and question generation;N-gramoverlap scoring; PyPDF, pdfminer, fitz, and pymupdf forPDF filetext extraction and manipulation; Python and JavaScript code generation, analysis, and debugging; Milvus vector database[15]to store and retrieve vector embeddings; Weaviate vector database[16]to cache embedding and data objects;Rediscache database storage; Python RequestsWrapper and other methods for API requests;SQLandNoSQLdatabases includingJSONsupport; Streamlit, including for logging; text mapping fork-nearest neighborssearch;time zoneconversion and calendar operations; tracing and recording stack symbols inthreadedandasynchronous subprocessruns; and theWolfram Alphawebsite and SDK.[17]As of April 2023, it can read from more than 50 document types and data sources.[18]
